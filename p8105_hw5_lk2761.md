## Problem 1

The following code chunk generates missing values in the
`iris_with_missing` dataframe.

``` r
iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

The following code chunk shows a function that will replace the missing
values in each variable. For numeric variables, the missing values will
be replaced with column mean. For character variables, the

``` r
output = vector("list", length = 5)

iris_filling = function(x) {
  
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    x = replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  }
  else if (is.character(x)) {
    x = replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
  
}

output = map(iris_with_missing, iris_filling)
```

## Problem 2

This code chunk creates a dataframe that consists of the file names and
converts it into a vector.

``` r
df = list.files(pattern = "*.csv")

vec_file = str_c(df)
```

This code chunk creates a function that reads in data for each subject
from each individual csv file and saves the weekly observations as a new
varaible in the dataframe.

``` r
for (i in length(df):1) {
  output[[i]] = read_csv(vec_file[[i]])
}

output = cbind(vec_file, map_df(vec_file, read_csv))
```

This code chunk tidies the resulting dataframe obtained from the for
loop.

``` r
study_df = 
  output %>%
  separate(vec_file, c("control_arm", "subject_id")) %>%
  separate(subject_id, c("subject_id", "csv"), ".csv") %>%
  select(-csv)
```
